BTT Manta CB1 Fan

Two files of the same part, one STL one STEP.

This is a mount for a 30mm 5VDC fan to cool the heatsink on a BigTreeTech (BTT) CB1 compute module and heatsink. Typically used on a Manta series machine control board.

The fan will cool the board about 5-10 degrees F below natural convection. 

Part has a "diving board" to stick the WiFi antenna onto as well as two holes for cable ties to manage the antenna wire.
